## Gang of Four Design Patterns

Code examples are written in ruby and taken from Jose Mota's Tuts+ course. 
Original files should also be available in github but these files are writtern by me and the focus was the understanding of the implementations not the folder/class hierarchies

* Iterator
* Mediator
* Observer
* Proxy
